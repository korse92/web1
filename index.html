  <h2>Hip hop</h2>
  <p>
  <strong><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop" target="_blank" title="Hip hop Wiki">Hip hop, or hip-hop,</a></u> is a subculture and art movement</strong> developed in the Bronx in New York City during the late 1970s.
  <br>
  The origins of the word are often disputed. It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx.
